            The game is broken ⚡  because it is too slow. Go to [docs/index.html](../blob/main/docs/index.html#L78) line 78 and adjust `start` and `min` properties of speed and set the to the following values:

            ```js
            speed   = { start: 0.6, decrement: 0.005, min: 0.1 }
            ```
